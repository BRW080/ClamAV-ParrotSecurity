# ClamAV in GNU/Linux?
ClamAV is a popular and easy-to-use tool for detecting virus infections on Linux systems. It is open source and free, and runs on many Linux systems, including Ubuntu and Fedora.

## Steps before installing ClamAV
1. Have all packages installed according to your Debian Distribution:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
2. Update the system completely:
```bash
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

## Steps to install ClamAV
1. Clone the Github repository in terminal (CTRL+ALT+T):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BRW080/ClamAV-ParrotSecurity.git
```
2. Access the newly created folder:
```bash
cd ClamAV-ParrotSecurity
```

3. Access the ProtonVPN folder:
```bash
cd ClamAV
```

## Installing ClamAV, ClamTK and Clam-daemon
1. Give execute permissions to the "install.sh" file:
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

2. Run the script once with execute permissions:
```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

3. In case an error occurs when installing it (although it is very common), execute the following:
```bash
systemctl stop clamav-freshclam.service
```

4. Once the service is turned off, start the service again by executing:
```bash
systemctl start clamav-freshclam.service
```

5. Check if you installed it correctly:
```bash
sudo systemctl status clamav-freshclam
```

# APPLICATION TESTING
1. Scan for malware or any type of malicious file (in this case we will select the entire hard drive):
```bash
sudo clamscan -ri --exclude-dir=/sys/ /
```

### Steps to move files to quarantine
1. Create a folder with the name you like, in this case it was Quarantine-ClamAV:
```bash
mkdir "Quarantine-ClamAV"
```

2. Then you have to go to the next file (you can choose whatever, recommended: NANO):
```bash
crontab -e
```

3. Once inside, in the last line of code we put the following:
````bash
30 00 * * * echo 3 > -ri --move /home/parrot/"Quarantine ClamAV" --exlude-dir=/sys/ /
```

3.1 That means that every day at 12:30 in the morning it will scan the entire hard drive and if it finds a malicious file it will quarantine it and send it to the specific folder in this case that you choose.
